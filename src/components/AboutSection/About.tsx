            Back in 2018, I led a team of 5 other high school students to launch
            the largest high school hackathon in the Midwest.With 9 months of
            planning, $20,000 raised from various sponsors, hundreds of emails,
            and n-th cups of coffee, Hack Chicago proudly exposed 300+ high
            school students to coding.

            With project management experience, I'm interested on working
            ambitious projects with other curious people.
